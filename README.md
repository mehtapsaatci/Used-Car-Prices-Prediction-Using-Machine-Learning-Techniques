# Used-Car-Prices-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

Used car price estimation plays an important role for both consumers and sellers. Within the scope of this project, price estimation was studied by using the used vehicle dataset obtained from the Kaggle site. Machine learning models were applied after the dataset pre-processing stage was made. Models used in this project are Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest. The performance of the models was evaluated by looking at the R2, MSE and MAPE values.
